## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- sympy
- tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

Install the required dependency using:

```bash
pip install sympy
How to Run
Save the script as calculus_solver.py and run it:

bash
Copy
Edit
python calculus_solver.py
Example Inputs
Integration
integrate x^2 dx

integrate sin(x) dx

integrate x^2 from 0 to 5

Differentiation
differentiate x^3 + 2*x

derive sin(x)*cos(x)

Evaluation
sin(pi/2)

cos(0)

sqrt(16)

2 + 3 * 4

Input Guidelines
Use * for multiplication: 2*x not 2x

Use ^ for exponents: x^2 not x2

Use sqrt(), log(), exp() for standard functions

Trigonometric functions are evaluated in radians

Use with respect to or dx, dy to specify variables

Use pi for Ï€ and E for Euler's constant
